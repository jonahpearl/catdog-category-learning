# catdog-category-learning
Doing the catdog analysis, the right way this time.

Note: the passive viewing code (scripts with the "pv" prefix) often refers to "trials" in the comments. I use "trial" as shorthand in my comments for "the presentation of an image". However, the Monkeys structure contains a structure named "TrialInfo" which is not about individual image presentations. Instead, those are trials from the perspective of the behavioral task, which presents five images per trial. Because most of this code doesn't deal with the TrialInfo structure -- it uses the CueInfo structure (which is intially constructed from the TrialInfo structure) to get all the times each image was presented and works from there -- this shouldn't be a big problem. Just FYI in case someone looks closely.
(NB also, in the category training task (scripts with the "skip" prefix), each trial really does only present one image, on which the monkey must release the bar in one of two intervals to classify the image as a cat or dog.)
